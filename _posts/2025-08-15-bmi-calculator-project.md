title: "My Java Project — BMI Calculator"

This is my **second blog post**, and it’s about my very first Java project: a simple **BMI Calculator**.

---

## 💡 What it does
The program asks for height and weight, then calculates the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** using the formula:



After the calculation, it tells you if you are:
- Underweight  
- Normal weight  
- Overweight  
- Obese

## 🎯 Why I built it
I wanted to escape the “tutorial hell” and create something from scratch.  
It’s a small project, but it was my first real step in Java outside of following tutorials.

---

## 📚 What I learned
- How to use **Scanner** to take input from the user  
- How to apply **if / else if / else** conditions  
- How to structure a simple program in Java

## 🔗 Repository
You can find the full project here:

This project may be small, but for me it’s proof that I can build something on my own.  
Next step: bigger projects, more experiments, and steady improvement 🚀
