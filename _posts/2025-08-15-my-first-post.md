This is my very first post on this blog.  

I decided to start writing here because I want to document my journey as a beginner programmer.  
I’m learning step by step — experimenting with small games, simple tools, and different programming concepts.  

This blog is not about being perfect or teaching others.  
It’s about keeping track of what I’m doing, what I learn along the way, and how I grow over time.  

If you’re reading this, welcome — you’re catching me at the very beginning.
