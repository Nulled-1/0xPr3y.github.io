# Who is Nulled?

My name is **Nulled**, and I’m a beginner programmer still building my foundation.

This site is my personal log — a place to document my journey in programming and technology.

---

## Where It Started

It began with curiosity.  
At first, I wasn’t really coding — just experimenting, installing things, and trying to understand how software works.

Over time, I realized I wanted to do more than just use tools — I wanted to **create** them.

---

## Now

I’m focusing on learning programming step by step.  
My main interests are:

- **Game development** — creating simple projects to practice design and logic.  
- **Tool development** — building small utilities to improve my skills.  
- **Learning journey** — steadily improving from beginner level toward intermediate.

I’m not an expert — but I’m consistent, and I’m learning every day.

## What This Site Is For

This website is my **logbook** — a space where I track:

- My progress in learning programming  
- Small projects and experiments  
- Tools and scripts I create  
- Reflections on what I’m learning  

It’s not a portfolio or a brand.  
It’s simply the record of a beginner who is growing in programming.
