# ðŸ“š Blog

This is where I share my journey.

Youâ€™ll find short posts about:

- Learning programming step by step  
- Progress in building small games and tools  
- Reflections on what worked and what didnâ€™t  
- Notes from experiments and projects  
- Personal thoughts as I grow from beginner to better

I donâ€™t write as an expert.  
I write as a **beginner sharing the process** â€” honest and simple.

Stay tuned.
